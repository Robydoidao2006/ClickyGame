## Rules of the Game
 - Click on an image and remember which one you clicked.
 - You should not click the same image, the goal its to click all 12 images.
 - On the header there is a reset button, a score mark(keeps track of current points, but resets when you lose) and 
   a top score, wich will keep you highest score, unless you click the reset button or refresh the page.
